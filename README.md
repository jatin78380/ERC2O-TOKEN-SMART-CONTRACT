# ERC2O-TOKEN-SMART-CONTRACT


This project consists of two Solidity files, `ERC20.sol` and `OPENERC20.sol`, both related to ERC-20 token development. The `OPENERC20.sol` file includes code from the OpenZeppelin library.

## ERC-20 Token

### File: `ERC20.sol`

This Solidity file contains the implementation of a basic ERC-20 token. It includes the standard functions and events required for ERC-20 compliance. The token is designed to be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

#### Deployment on Remix IDE

To deploy the ERC-20 file on Remix IDE:

1. Open Remix IDE ([remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org/)).
2. Create a new file and copy the contents of `ERC20.sol` into the editor.
3. Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler.
4. Deploy the contract  using Remix IDE.


### File: `OPENERC20.sol`

This Solidity file extends the ERC-20 token implementation by incorporating code from the OpenZeppelin library. OpenZeppelin is a library for secure smart contract development.

#### Deployment on Remix IDE

To deploy the OpenERC-20 file on Remix IDE:

1. Open Remix IDE ([remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org/)).
2. Create a new file and copy the contents of `OPENERC20.sol` into the editor.
3. Ensure that the OpenZeppelin library is imported correctly.
4. Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler.
5. Deploy the contract using Remix IDE.
